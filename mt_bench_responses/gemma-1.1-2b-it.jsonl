Its weathered facade, etched with the ghosts of forgotten memories, whispered tales of a past shrouded in mystery. The wind, a mournful sigh through skeletal branches, rustled the faded ivy clinging to its crumbling walls.\n\nAmelia, drawn by an insatiable curiosity, found herself standing before this enigmatic dwelling. The overgrown garden, once a vibrant tapestry of blooms, was now a barren wasteland. The air hung heavy with a melancholic stillness, amplified by the mournful cries of crickets.\n\nAs she approached, the house loomed larger, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. The peeling paint and crumbling stones gave it an air of neglect, as if time itself had frozen within its decaying embrace. A shiver of anticipation coursed through Amelia as she reached for the rusted doorbell, its silent plea echoing her own unspoken longing.\n\nWith a creak and a groan, the door creaked open, revealing a cavernous hall shrouded in darkness. Shadows danced and flickered in the dim light filtering through narrow windows, creating an otherworldly spectacle. As Amelia ventured deeper, the silence pressed in, pressing down on her senses like a suffocating blanket.\n\nSuddenly, a soft whisper drifted through the air, carrying with it an intoxicating aroma of forgotten dreams. Amelia's heart skipped a beat. The voice, ethereal and timeless, beckoned her deeper into the house.\n\nWith a newfound resolve, Amelia pushed aside the layers of neglect and ventured into the unknown. The path forward was shrouded in an ethereal veil, leading to a hidden chamber. As her eyes adjusted, she gasped in astonishment.\n\nWithin this forgotten realm, she discovered a collection of ancient books, their pages whispering secrets long forgotten. She learned of a powerful artifact hidden within the house, a relic with the power to heal the sick and mend broken hearts.\n\nAmelia's quest had just begun. The secret of the abandoned house had unleashed a force that threatened the delicate balance of the world.

Mars is a blank slate, a pristine canvas begging to be shaped into a utopia.\n\nThink about the possibilities! We can colonize, build industries, create a spacefaring civilization. We can mine asteroids for critical minerals, develop sustainable energy solutions, and even terraform the planet to make it habitable for humans.\n\nAnd let's not forget the **colonization potential**. Imagine the stories we'd tell our grandkids about our audacious venture to Mars. We'd be building a legacy for them, a testament to our ingenuity and perseverance.\n\nYes, it'll be challenging. We gotta deal with the technical hurdles, the challenges of establishing self-sustaining life in a new environment. But just like anything else worthwhile in life, achieving Mars is worth every bit of effort.\n\nSo let's stop dreaming about Mars as a distant fantasy. Let's turn that dream into a reality.

A curious contraption, designed to dry clothes in a manner that defies the laws of physics as understood by most mortals. They offer a sterile, dust-free environment for delicate fabrics, while simultaneously emitting a symphony of clanking and whirring that can drive a person to madness.\n\nOne must admire their unwavering dedication to efficiency. No need for electricity, no need for water, just a gentle nudge in the direction of warm, dry air. And the results? Well, the results are a slightly damp garment and a sense of smug accomplishment.\n\nBut let us not forget the ethical implications. Hand dryers, by their very nature, are a symbol of our futile attempts to control the universe. We cling to them like a desperate man clutching a life raft in a hurricane, desperately trying to force moisture out of fabric.\n\nAnd yet, despite their flaws, hand dryers have a certain charm. They are a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming complexity, there is still a place for simple, primal solutions. And who knows, perhaps their relentless hum holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe itself."

That's essentially what a language model is \u2013 a computer program trained on a massive dataset of text and code to understand and generate human-like text.\n\n**Is it trained on labeled or unlabelled data?**\n\n* **Labeled data:** In traditional machine learning, data is categorized into two types:\n    - **Labeled data:** This data is manually tagged with specific information, like the correct answer or category for each example.\n    - **Unlabeled data:** This data lacks this tagging, and the model learns to identify patterns and relationships from the unlabeled data.\n* **Language models are typically trained on labeled data.** This means they are trained on massive amounts of text data that has already been manually labeled with the desired output, such as summarizing a text or generating a creative story.\n\n**Benefits of labeled data:**\n\n- Enables the model to learn specific patterns and relationships from labeled examples.\n- Improves the accuracy and relevance of the generated output.\n\n**Benefits of unlabeled data:**\n\n- Makes the model more versatile and adaptable to new situations.\n- Can handle complex and nuanced tasks that require understanding context and relationships.\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\n- A language model is like a chef.\n- **Labeled data is like the recipe:** It provides the chef with specific instructions and ingredients.\n- **Unlabeled data is like the blank canvas:** The chef uses their knowledge and skills to create a delicious dish from the unlabeled ingredients."

It starts at the leaves of the binary tree and recursively climbs up the tree to find the highest common ancestor.\n* The function takes two nodes as input and returns their highest common ancestor.\n* If the two nodes are at the same level, they are directly connected, so they are returned.\n* Otherwise, the function recursively finds the hca of the nodes' parents and returns it.\n* The function uses the concept of path compression to reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(log n).\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n* Best case: O(log n)\n* Average case: O(n)\n* Worst case: O(n)\n\n**Space Complexity:**\n\n* O(1) to store the path information during the recursion."
